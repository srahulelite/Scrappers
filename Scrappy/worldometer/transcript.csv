The Inbetweeners (2011) - full transcript,"Best friends Will McKenzie, Simon Cooper, Jay Cartwright and Neil Sutherland - who are not among the social outcasts, but also not cool enough to hang out with the cool kids who they aspire to be - have just graduated from their suburban London high school. Simon has finally been able to get Carli D'Amato, who he has been in love with since they were children, to be his girlfriend. Largely because they will be going away to different schools in the fall, Carli breaks up with him. To get Simon's singularly focused mind off Carli, his three best mates decide to take him on vacation for two weeks to get some sun, sand and girls before they move onto the next chapter of their lives in the fall. Neil makes the decision for them to go to Malia on the isle of Crete, a popular summer tourist destination for many a Brit. Jay, with inheritance money in hand, believes he can have the pick of any girl he wants. Neil has to decide what constitutes not cheating on his girlfriend, Nicole. Will wants to add a bit of culture into the vacation. And Simon still pines for Carli, getting her off his mind being more difficult when he learns why Neil chose Malia. What starts off as a disastrous vacation has the potential to pick up when they meet fellow Brits Alison, Lucy, Jane and Lisa, who pair up with Will, Simon, Jay and Neil respectively, and with who they hang, out of circumstance, for much of their time in Malia. Will the virgin, who generally makes Alison laugh, has no chance with her as she is far out of his league, and as she is already in a serious relationship with a Greek waiter named Nicos. Jay is ashamed to be seen with self-assured Jane, because she is overweight. Neil treats Lisa like any other female with who he wants to have non-cheating ""sex"". And Simon may not see that Lucy really does like him despite his singular focus on Carli. All these issues are placed against the backdrop of the guys trying to get tickets for the all-day boat cruise, seen as the party of the season, and at which all their dreams - at least in their dreams - will come true.","api.OpenSubtitles.org is deprecated, please,implement REST API from OpenSubtitles.com,So, you see the thing is, Dad,,I could reapply next year,,but if I defer and try again for Oxford,,I'll probably lose my place at Bristol...,Mm...,which is a good university,but not my dream.,Do you think,it matters in the long term,,or is the subject and standard of degree,more important?,So, I got married.,- What?!,- To Suzy, we got married.,You mean remarried.,This time it's for keeps, though.,
,
,
,- When did this happen?,- A few weeks ago.,I was going to invite you,,but I know how you are around people.,How am I?!,Awkward.

Well, not that long.,He shagged the work experience girl,and then left us.,So, just clichéd, really.,Plus, it only happened two years ago,,so I don't even get the luxury,of blaming my various personality defects,on their divorce.,Anyway, that's how I ended up here -,the very definition of suburbia.,Safe, comforting, stifling, boring -,and I couldn't wait to fucking leave.,Maybe that's unfair, as they do say,that you never know what goes on,behind the net curtains of suburbia.,Although, in my friend Jay Cartwright's,case, you can have a pretty good guess.,Are you ready to have some fun, big boy?,Mmm.,I'm feeling sexy!,Take off mask, baby, let me see you.,Nah.,Do you promise this'll be,properly filthy, yeah?,Oh, yes, like bomb explode from in penis.,Sexy like... mmm...,finger up bumhole.,Christ, you make me so erect.,Oh, yes, you also make me erect.,Now, put in card details.,Oh, I'm so horny.,Don't forget security number and bank.,Mm!

This isn't the Dead Poets Society,and I'm not that bloke on BBC Two,who keeps getting kids to sing in choirs.,I especially don't want to hear about,how well you're settling down at uni,or how much growing up you've done,in the past 12 months.,At best, I am ambivalent,towards most of you,,but some of you, I actively dislike,,for no other reason,than your poor personal hygiene,or your irritating personalities.,I hope I've made myself clear,on this point.,And in case any of you think,I'm joking... I'm not.,I assure you,that once my legal obligation...,to look after your best interests,is removed,,I can be one truly nasty fucker.,Good luck with the rest of your lives,and... try not to kill anyone.,It reflects very badly on all of us here.,Slightly more upbeat,than I was expecting.,They say your school days,are the best days of your life.,But the only way,that would be true for me...,would be if I went straight from school,to prison and stayed there until I died.,How many times is that,she's caught you now?,Four. But this was the worst.,Mask, snorkel, ham.,OK, one last one for luck.,Ooooh!,Good. Old-school wedgie.,To be admired, in a way.,Squashing the balls now.,Ooh! That does not tickle!,Argh!,Mark!

That's great. ,Nobody watches movies anymore these days.,Hey, hey, hey, hey.,Ah, this is ""Raihun"" (title of a movie).,Do you know it if you watch it?,Anna, a country girl, was deceived ,by a man and had a miscarriage.,She hides the truth and ,works as a maid for a living.,But she gets exposed and ,gets kicked out in the heavy snow.,Lilian Gish, who plays Anna, ,is so beautiful, so I remember.,What the... I've made up,my mind to burn the film reels.,This theater was built by my grandfather, ,probably in the Taisho era.,""Raihun"" was released in Tokyo in 1922.,The following year, this theater was established.,My grandfather watched that film in Tokyo,and decided to screen it as, the first film at Asahi Theater.,How can we burn such an important film?,If we don't burn this important film, ,how can we make up our minds?,They say a grocery store ,can survive for three generations.,There's no choice. ,Times change, you know?,Times change?,If this place disappears, ,where will the locals watch movies?,Who should I ask if you ask me?,It has survived many disasters ,over the past century, even earthquakes.,That means this theater ,shouldn't disappear even more.,In the end, it was defeated, by the COVID-19 pandemic.,It will take another year or, two to return to normal life.,It can't hold on for that long.,Relying on donations... and such?,We don't accept donations. ,They should go to other theaters, right?,It would be meaningful if other, theaters could be saved.,That's how I convinced myself and ,made up my mind to burn the film reels.,Alright?

I'm not playing around.,I'm not playing around... ah!,By the way, who are you?,It doesn't matter who I am.,It does matter. ,Being pointed at by a stranger...,You better give me your name, ,or I'll call the police.,Mogi...,Mogi?,Mogi Riko ,(sounds like ""ticket collector"" in Japanese).,Right, Mogi Riko.,I'm Mogi Riko.,My real name is Asahi Hamano.,Hamano as in ""seaside"" and ""field."",During my first year of high school, ,the Great East Japan Earthquake happened.,My dad used to work at, a taxi company in Koriyama.,But all transportation companies, were afraid of radiation,and didn't send cars for decontamination workers.,So, he decided to go to Minamisoma ,alone to be in charge of transportation.,Gasoline was scarce, ,and natural gas taxis were in high demand.,At first, he received praise,,but when it was known that he made a lot of money,,people's attitudes changed, and they accused him, of profiting from the national disaster.,His company was called ,""Hamano Asahi Transportation."",And my name, including both my first ,and last names, was associated with it.,As a result, my family faced harassment.,My mother and younger brother, ,who stayed in Koriyama, were also ostracized.,Our family was on the verge of falling apart.,Because of those rumors,,I lost all my friends. ,They all left me like the receding tide.,Hey.,How did you get the key to the rooftop?,You can't go up there without ,permission from the teachers.,-Sorry. ,-Hmm.,So... how did you get the key?,I... made a spare.,Huh?,I also have a spare key.,This place is nice for some alone time.,But... it's not good if you jump from here.,What's with that expression?,Why...,I've seen you before.,And you're kind of famous at our school too.,Every time, you look like you want to die.,Today, seeing you like that, ,I had to stop you.,It's like I'm the monitor for ,the cliffs of Toshinbo or something.,It's up to you how you want to do it; ,it's your freedom.,But now is also my precious time to relax.,If someone jumps off a building in front of me, ,it will be traumatizing for my soul.,I heard you're transferring to another school?,Where are you transferring to?,Tokyo.,Tokyo is great. ,I used to live there.,It has everything and is very convenient.,But I don't want to go.,Maybe it's better than living ,here with no friends.,I've been here for years, ,and I still have two more to go.,I feel really sorry about it.,But... the world is not just this place, ,you know?,Come with me.,This place is perfect for secretly watching movies.,Here we are.,Hey, Tanaka-sensei. ,Are you using this room?,Sorry, Principal. I'm tutoring a student.,Okay, I just saw the door was unlocked.,Goodbye.,Take care.,That was close. Thankfully, ,it hadn't started playing yet.,Dad, it's because he doesn't truly love ,someone that he acts like this.,If you love Mom, ,why did you abandon her?,If you don't want to leave Mom, ,why don't you love her?,Dad is just full of lies,Dad, please use your true heart to love Mom,(The end of the play),You can't tell on DVDs, but with film,,say half the time is pitch black.,Do you have a notebook?,I need a pen too.,Film is made up of frames, ,24 frames per second.,When you connect them, ,it becomes a film strip.,To project it onto a screen, ,you need a projector.,The projector allows light to pass ,through the film and onto the screen.,But there are lines between each frame of the film.,If you directly project it continuously, ,you'll see those lines.,So the projector uses a ,shutter to block those lines.,The shutter has notches that look like a fan.,Between the fan blades, ,a brief ray of light emerges.,The shutter only allows light ,to pass through the fan blades.,It relies on the lingering afterimage ,of that moment to carry over to the next frame.,Have you heard of the phenomenon ,of visual persistence in human eyes?,It means that half the time, ,you're looking at a dark screen.,Sounds quite interesting, doesn't it?,Half the time, watching darkness, ,yet still moved and laughing.,That's why movie enthusiasts tend ,to have a gloomy personality, right?,But that's not a bad thing, right?,Tokyo has many movie theaters, you know.,Mostly multiplexes, I guess.,Let me tell you something.,Imagine what it will be like 100 years from now.,Anyway, you won't be in this world by then.,How about it?,I thought you were going ,to say something inspiring.,Can adults who say such things be trusted?,Anyway, it's okay not to hurry and die today.,""It's okay""... It sounds strange to say ""it's okay."",Riko Mogi?,Yes, Mogi... Riko Mogi.,I'm Riko Mogi.,Mogi... the ticket collector...,Are you messing with me, ,you little brat?,I'm serious, that's my real name. ,I won't change it.,You can't even speak clearly.,I was born for movies, ,and I can operate projectors too.,Once you teach me, I'll be able to do it.,I told you, we're closing.,There's no need to hire anyone.,And even before the pandemic, ,nobody came anymore.,Although I'm the owner, ,my real profession is electrical work.,Otherwise, how could I make a living?,There was a time when movie theaters ,were busier than electrical work.,But that was a long time ago.,But... we don't need to demolish it, right?,I've already talked to the real estate company.,A company wants to buy this place, ,saying they'll build a large public bath.,They'll set up a small stage and invite singers.,They'll also create a rehabilitation center ,on the second floor.,Benefiting the community, ,benefiting the people.,Which real estate company, are you talking about?,Why do you want to know?,Never mind. Which one?,Sorry, I wanted to ask about Asahi Theater.,Oh, what about Asahi Theater?,I want to know which company wants to buy it.,And if it can be prevented from, being demolished.,Uh... something like that...,Yasuza!,Oh, Who is this young lady?,I don't know either...,He's my relative.

JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time (2014) - full transcript,"The Legion of Doom are attempting to use space satellites to freeze the Earth's oceans, creating more land mass at the coastal regions for which they own. The JLA quickly arrive and the two teams engage in a classic battle of wills. This clash leads to Lex Luthor becoming trapped in a glacier of ice. In the 31st century Legion of Superheroes trainees; Dawnstar and Karate Kid are tasked with minding the Legion's museum. Their tour leads them to Lex Luthor's memorial; his body still encased in a large chuck of ice discovered in the 29th century. Karate Kid Inadvertently frees Luthor who secretly explores the museum himself, and soon uncovers the shrine to his greatest nemesis Superman. There he learns of the Kent's involvement in Kal-El's discovery. Luthor following the voices of Dawnstar and Karate Kid takes possession of an hourglass which holds the Time Trapper within. Whoever holds the hourglass controls this entity who is the master of time. Luthor returns to the 21st century, but not without the young Legionaries close behind. The Legion of Doom regroups with a new plan in place; they will prevent the Kent's from ever raising Kal-El, and with no Superman the JLA will cease to exist as well. The JLA arrive but Luthor's efforts prove to be successful, and the Time Trapper causes the time paradoxes to vanish from this reality. Now it's up to Dawnstar and Karate Kid to stop Luthor's plans for worldwide dominance. They find a loophole freeing the Time Trapper from Luthor's control, but now nothing is preventing him from wrecking chaos throughout reality. The JLA return, but well their power combined with Dawnstar and Karate Kid prove to be enough to stop this new menace, or has our time just run out?","Do you want subtitles for any video?,-=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=-,Now is the hour...,...we set into motion cataclysmic change,to the planet.,The legion of doom shall rule,in a new world order.,No one can stop us.,I do not understand, Lex Luthor.,I thought we were melting the polar ice caps.,No, my dear cheetah, the exact opposite.,As those glaciers swell,,the world's water level shrinks...,...expanding the coastlines,of every continent.,Black manta:,Land we already own.,Another brilliant plan from a brilliant mind.,

His house is blown asunder.. ,he stands isolated ,Because you always kept him out of your life ,Aarti only had to die.. ,for you to go about making people's lives ,Couldn't you spot me anywhere? ,Once earlier, you had walked out of my life ,And now, you're walking out again ,Do not ruin me anymore ,Whatever you say, I'm not changing the path I have chosen ,And Raja has decided his path too ,I'm taking you away ,Either you come of your own volition, or I'll have to create a scene ,Don't force me, please ,It would be better if we end this here and now ,Even creating a scene will end it once and for all ,I'm leaving ,In that case, I too will ruin your happy family before I leave ,I leave that to you, Raja ,Whether you call me loyal for the decision I've taken.. ,or even unfaithful ,""Do not view the thorns with such contempt.."" ,""they're useful too"" ,""Have not love for roses alone"" ,""The one I've lost my heart to.."" ,""The one I've lost my heart to.."" ,""is an unfaithful woman, she is faithless"" ,""My love for you is indeed a curse.."" ,""My love for you is indeed a curse.."" ,""for you are unfaithful, you are faithless"" ,""The one I've lost my heart to.."" ,""The one I've lost my heart to.."" ,""for you are unfaithful, you are faithless"" ,""A glass wrecked.."" ,""causes a shrill noise"" ,""The cries of a broken heart.."" ,""no one listens to"" ,""I'm crazy, mad, obsessed.."" ,""in her memories, I live.
